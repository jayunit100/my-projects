In order to test hostname headers in Traefik, please...

1. Install kubernetes with exactly 1 Public Node inside the DC/OS GUI (HA is optional)
2. Find the public kubelet's node IP by running 'run 'kubectl describe node 'kube-node-public-0-kubelet.kubernetes.mesos'
3. Edit your local machine's ''/etc/hosts' file with the '<public-kubernetes-node-IP'> www.k8sdcos-cheddar.com'

Note: In this example we are using only 1 out of the 3 cheese services to illustrate hostname headers
and the ability to link these back to backend pods and loadbalancers via a single Traefik controller

Once you have finished the pre-requisites, please continue.."

NOTE: This will install all pods, services, and ingress rules to expose ONLY the cheddar web service running NGINX
The other 2 web services will not be resolvable on your network unless you expose the service over a designated portDefinitions
and configure a working hostname inside your /etc/hosts file

This is not needed 'for' this demo, but you can accomplish this by:

1. Simply configuring the 'hostname' field within the cheese-ingress.yaml file
2. Adding the hostnames to your /etc/hosts file of your 'local' machine like we have configured 'for' cheddar
3. Exposing the service using the commands:

      kubectl expose service stinton --port=443 --target-port=8444 --name=stinton-http
      kubectl expose service cheddar --port=443 --target-port=8445 --name=wensleydale-http"
